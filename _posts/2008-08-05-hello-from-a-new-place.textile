I decided to go ahead and get myself a domain so I resisted and got my own site:
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.youhhoo.com/">http://www.youhhoo.com</a></p>

Of course I did not get what I waned which was youhoo.com (one less h) but apparently Yahoo owns it and just displays a "Page Not Found" type of thing. That sucks!

Anyway, WELCOME to my new home. :D
