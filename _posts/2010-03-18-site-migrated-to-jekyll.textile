p. When I first built my web site, I wanted a bit of practice building and deploying a Rails application so I used my personal website as an excuse. But as you might have guessed, it was overkill and I tried to make the site do more than it needed to just to server a different purpose. The over complication also made it undesirable to update the content. It was time for a change and I knew it. 

p. I first looked into Jekyll when I was looking for the simplest tool for hosting a blog for a small project I was doing for work. I wanted an easy way to do my daily write up and post it to the site. The project dealt with CMS projects and particularly in the Ruby world, and I came across Jekyll and thought it was the perfect tool for what I needed. After using it for a while I really liked it more and more and now I recommend it to any techie who wants to blog. It is my ideal way of pushing static content to a site because I love to edit in TextMate and just be able to run a couple of commands in the Terminal and have the content live. And with Jekyll, all I have to do is commit to GitHub and run one rake command __rake deploy__ and I'm done. 

p. So there you go. The site is migrated to a new platform, all for just one day of work along with a fresh new look.
