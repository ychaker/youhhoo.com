p. Those of you who know me know that I am a supporter and user of almost every social networking site available. I have been also known to defend these sites against people do not use, understand or agree with these sites.

p. Even though I have been updating my site, most of these updates have been in the background and are not visible to the people who visit the site (such as the way I upload pictures). I finally made a visible change to my site. The main ones are concerned with social networking and social media. I added icons next to the navigation menu that provide links to my public profiles (eg: twitter, facebook ...), and I also added a small twitter feed on the homepage.

p. Enjoy!
