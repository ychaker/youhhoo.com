p. This is an idea that is so simple in its principal but yet so meaningful and important for the progress of this small yet complex country. It is articulated, expanded and discussed in the three-part documentary from the people behind <a href="http://www.thelebanonidreamof.com" target="_blank">The Lebanon I Dream Of</a>.

p. In that documentary one person mentions that the change needs to come from a revolution and then poses the question of who will lead this revolution. The documentary proposes that the people need to be the leaders and manifest it through the elections. And I agree, but I also feel that the people need one person or a group of people to take on the role of "Captain of the Ship".

p. With the way the political system is setup in the country, I hope that someone from the ruling families will finally see the benefit of doing the right thing for the people and not just for his own pockets. Or that at least with the many conflicting interests among the political leaders in the country, some sort of compromise would come in the benefit of the people. The first idea does not seem likely to happen any time soon, and even though we've seen signs of the second idea taking place, the compromise does not seem good enough.

p. The country and its people need MORE. I do not have popular politcal views, mainly because I do not support any of the so called leaders in the country. In fact I am the opposition to the government and the opposition to the opposition all at once. I believe that the Lebanese people should get out of the politics business and get into the service business. For that to happen, the political leaders in the country need to give up their power and allow a new generation and type of leaders to take over. Something that will not happen on its own, something that requires a lot of struggle and fight. Sadly, the Lebanese people are running out of their will to fight and are living on a prayer that they will be able to survive each day as it comes.

Ip.  also had this hope that the country is resilient enough that even though corrupt politicians are in control, they will eventually die, or get too old and give up this power struggle. That turned out to be a false hope when each time one leader is out of the game (which ever way it may be), his wife and his sons and daughters take over the family business. Thus we go from one leader we could not wait to get rid of to a multitude of his evil spawns.

p. For many, this piece might seem a bit too late since the elections were 20 days ago. Well, I did not see the change I was hoping for this time around but that just meant that it was time to act for the next opportunity. Obama said a few days ago to a bunch of reporters that they worked on a 24 hour news cycle whereas he did not, he works with the future in mind. Lebanese politicians are similar to these reporters, they work on an election cycle, I don't! Most Lebanese took the sum of money they were offered, voted on that sunday and now are off doing whatever they do for the next four years until the next elections come around. I can't do that!

<p style="text-align: center;">ACT NOW!</p>

p. Are you going to wake up four years from now, start complaining and blaming the people you voted for yourself for stealing your future from you yet again while you laid dormant? Or are you going to do something about it?

<p style="text-align: center;">ACT NOW!</p>

p. Are you going to watch those leaders make decisions that only benefit their own personal interest while sacrificing the interest of the country? Or are you going fight for accountability?

<p style="text-align: center;">ACT NOW!</p>
