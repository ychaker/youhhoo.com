p. I found this interesting site: www.wordle.net that lets you create a word image of your blog. The result for this particular one was interesting to me:

p. <a href="http://www.wordle.net/gallery/wrdl/1031877/Youhhoo.com" title="Wordle: Youhhoo.com"><img src="http://www.wordle.net/thumb/wrdl/1031877/Youhhoo.com" alt="Wordle: Youhhoo.com"  style="padding:4px;border:1px solid #ddd"></a>

p. Notice the central word in the biggest font: PEOPLE. Then notice the words that jump out next: Lebanese, Leaders, One, Idea, Country, Lebanon, Interest, Person. Seems to sum up pretty nicely what this blog sort of revolves around.
